			<h2 class="title">About Me</h2>

			<section class="row">

				<p>
					As an <b>ambitious and motivated aspiring programmer</b>, I thrive on tackling challenging 
					problems, exploring innovative technologies, and developing my professional skills.
				</p>

					<h3><a id="present">
						Present (What am I doing now?)
					</h3></a>

					Currently I am pursuing a <b>B.S. in Computer Science</b> and a minor in 
					Graphic Communications at NC State University.

					<br>
					<br>

					I strive for excellence in all my academic pursuits, demonstrated with a 3.98 GPA,
					active membership in numerous honor societies, (including the NC State Scholars Program, Tau Beta Pi,
					and the Intel Scholars Program,) and a commitment to practical application of the skills and knowledge I learn
					in class. 
					<br>
					<br>
					To apply my academic knowledge in a professional environment, I joined the co-op program, alternating semesters of full-time work as a 
					<b>data analyst and software engineer</b> at Highland Industries with semesters of academic work for two years. Developing solutions 
					to the projects assigned to me required <b>strong time-management skills, a creative problem-solving and critical thinking mindset,
					and the ability to write reusable, user-friendly, and robust programs</b>. Over the year of work experience I completed, 
					I used the principals taught in my classes to solve real problems in the textiles manufacturing industry, saving hundreds
					of hours of manual data manipulation and increasing speed and efficiency of analysis in departments all over the plant,
					including the lab and R&D.
					<br>
					<br>
					During the school year, I work in a research lab dedicated to improving the training of guide dogs through analyzing the environmental conditions
					that produce the ideal dog. I enjoy this work not only because of the satisfaction of finding connections and meaning behind mountains of data, but also because
					my work is a small contribution towards making guide dogs more available for the people in need of them. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Along with academic knowledge and professional skills, I am developing my <b>leadership ability</b> through taking on leadership roles in my academic projects, 
					participating in programs such as the CSC Student Ambassadors, and as an Entrepreneurship Village Mentor.

					<h3><a id="future">
						Future (What are my goals?)
					</h3></a>

					To make a difference in the world, a person needs a target audience and a plan of action.
					My target audience are users who are not trained in data analysis but who still need to understand
					how data impacts their job ( such as doctors, managers, and many others ). With the tremendous amount
					of data available today, people in these kinds of jobs cannot ignore the benefit data analytics provides, 
					but often do not have the time or energy to learn how to gather and transform the data themselves. 
					<br>
					<br>
					My plan of action is to provide intuitive and powerful tools for these users to manipulate the data to uncover meaningful and 
					significant results. With these results, they can then make adjustments to their practice with confidence 
					and their own plans of action.

					<h3><a id="past"> 
						Past (What is my motivation?)
					</h3></a>

					Throughout my childhood, my parents encouraged my curiosity and creativity by 
					exposing me to many different combinations of art, science, culture, technology, nature, and 
					more, demonstrating how each discipline works to enhance the others. These experiences shaped
					my worldview into one that appreciates the beauty in logic and seeks out the structure and 
					foundation of art and creativity.

					<br>
					<br>

					So why does a programmer care about beauty and art? Because efficient programming and software development 
					requires creativity, inspiration, and a knack for thinking outside the box, all of which are traits 
					that are most effectively acquired through learning appreciation for beauty. Combining technical skills
					and creative thinking produces programs that are elegant, efficient, and effective.
